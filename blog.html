      <h2>Mod 1</h2>
      <p>3/8/16</p>
      <p>
        This module has been as empowering as it has been grueling. I've been very impressed by the culture of student support, and I wouldn't have made it even half-way through without the energy and drive everyone radiates. The materials and exercises are top-notch too. I hope I can make a few exercises of my own before I finish.

        My all-time favorite technical concept is a tough one to choose. I like binary search trees. Something about their simplicity and the way meaning is embedded into the tree structure speaks to me. Another contender would be artificial neural networks, mostly because traditionally computers have taken a very different approach to problem-solving when compared to biological systems, and it's exciting to see what advances in understanding we might make in both artificial and biological information systems.

      <h2>Advice to Incoming Students</h2>
      <p>3/6/18</p>
      <h3>  Build a community</h3>
        <p>No one can make it solo in life. Your fellow students will be <em>the</em> greatest resource in your time here. If you don't understand something, ask the student next to you. If you do understand something, explain it to the student next to you. Talking about code will help you learn it way faster than staring at your screen. Form study groups, wander around looking at different approaches to the same assignment. Everyone will have a different perspective and unique insights. Give resources, links, shortcuts, and encouragement.</p>
        <h3>Seek constant feedback</h3>
        <p>At the start of each new thing, you'll learn a lot by bumbling around in the dark, trying stuff at random. And that's great! Stretch yourself, take risks, realize there is zero cost for failure. Try as many things as you can while in that Exploration mode.</p>
        <p>Once you're done exploring, when you're in "Practice mode", <em>get as much feedback as you can</em>. That means feedback from mentors, co-students, but it also means learning how to get feedback from your own code. Error messages, IRB, tests, Pry, these will tell you what's working and what's wrong in your code. These will be your teachers. They'll give you instantaneous feedback. The more you use and pay attention to them, the better.</p>
        <h3>Ask for help</h3>
        <p>If you're stuck on one issue for more than 20 minutes, ask for help.</p>
        <p>Seriously. Just do it. This one was hard for me. If you're spinning your wheels, there's a more effective way to learn.</p>
        <h3>Drill the Fundamentals</h3>
        <p>Turing is fast paced, but if you can get a solid foundation at the beginning, it'll pay off with compound interest down the line. Do the homework, do core-type drills, mythical creatures, and learn as many shortcuts as you can. If you have a choice between shoring up one of your weak points or doing a bit extra on a project, choose your weak point. It'll make the next project that much easier.</p>
        <h3>Enjoy it</h3>
        <p>It's hard, but it's amazing! You're learning this crazy programming wizardry with the coolest people in the business. You'll look around in a few weeks and be amazed at how far you've come. So have a blast and tell a lot of jokes, laughter is the antidote to stress!</p>
