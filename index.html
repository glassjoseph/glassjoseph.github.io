      <h1>Joseph Glass</h1>
      <p>I am a student at the Turing School of Software and Design, studying Back-End Engineering. I'm interested in the intersection of technology and cognitive science, particularly with regard to learning and memory. I hope to develop applications that take advantage of psychological findings to improve traditional and online education. I like to read, bake bread, study psychology, and code.</p>

        <p> Data's no good if you can't use it. Black Friday is a Ruby-based learning project which transforms raw csv data into an Object Relational Map for easy data access and complex sales analytics. </p>

<!--  Hey! Welcome to my humble html! This isn't visible on my site, so you must have been poking around to find it. I confess I enjoy back-end more than front end, maybe because I'm more intrigued by the "why things work" than by how pretty they are. Since you're digging around here in the code with me, maybe you feel the same?-->
